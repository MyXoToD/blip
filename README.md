# BLIP

Blip is a 'Whack A Mole' prototype for Firefox OS. It has a very colorful but minimalist design. It is not finished yet but soon.

## Install

Of course you can install the beta if you want. You'll need a phone with firefox os running on it or an emulator (there are some plugins for your firefox browser).

All you need to do is:

1. Go to [http://blip.myxotod.com](http://blip.myxotod.com)
2. Play directly inside your browser or (if you're on an firefox os device) install it from the Firefox Marketplace.
